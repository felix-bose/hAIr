# hair ai

Small little demo application to upload an image and make transformations to the hair with AI by providing a system prompt.
Similar to what [LightX](https://www.lightxeditor.com/api/ai-hairstyle/) and [Remini](https://remini.ai/) do.

## Constraints

The current api's from OpenAI's Dall-e and Google Gemini 2.0 don't offer that functioniality out of the box "yet".
